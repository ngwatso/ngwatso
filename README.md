### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Nick!  I'm a former logistics managment professional who decided to follow my passion for creativity and problem solving and became a software engineer.  It has always been a dream of mine to work in the videogame industry, and I am learning everything I can to achieve that goal.  When I'm not hard at work at the computer, I love spending my off time with my beautiful wife and two children.
